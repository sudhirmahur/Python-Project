## 1. Introduction to Python
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.

### Key Features:
- **Easy to Learn**: Syntax is straightforward and similar to English.
- **Versatile**: Supports multiple paradigms (procedural, object-oriented, functional).
- **Extensive Libraries**: Comes with a rich set of libraries for various applications.

## 2. Python Basics

### Variables and Data Types
- Variables store data values.
- Common data types:
  - `int`: Integer
  - `float`: Floating-point number
  - `str`: String
  - `bool`: Boolean (True/False)

Example:
```python
x = 10      # Integer
y = 3.14    # Float
name = "Sudhir"  # String
is_valid = True  # Boolean
```

### Operators
- Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- Comparison: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
- Logical: `and`, `or`, `not`

## 3. Control Structures

### Conditional Statements
```python
if condition:
    # Code block
elif another_condition:
    # Code block
else:
    # Code block
```

### Loops
- **For Loop**:
  ```python
  for i in range(5):
      print(i)
  ```
- **While Loop**:
  ```python
  while condition:
      # Code block
  ```

---

## 4. Functions
Functions are reusable blocks of code.

### Defining Functions
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

### Lambda Functions
One-liner functions:
```python
add = lambda x, y: x + y
print(add(2, 3))
```

---

## 5. Python Data Structures

### Lists
Ordered, mutable collections:
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
```

### Tuples
Ordered, immutable collections:
```python
colors = ("red", "green", "blue")
```

### Dictionaries
Key-value pairs:
```python
person = {"name": "Sudhir", "age": 25}
```

### Sets
Unordered collections of unique items:
```python
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4}
```

---

## 6. Modules and Libraries

### Built-in Modules
- `math`: Mathematical functions
- `os`: Operating system interfaces

### External Libraries
Install using pip:
```bash
pip install library_name
```

---

## 7. File Handling

### Reading Files
```python
with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
```

### Writing Files
```python
with open("file.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, world!")
```

---

## 8. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### Classes and Objects
```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

p = Person("Sudhir", 25)
```

### Inheritance
```python
class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, age, student_id):
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self.student_id = student_id
```

---

## 9. Error and Exception Handling
```python
try:
    x = 1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print("Error:", e)
finally:
    print("Done")
```

---

## 10. Python Advanced Topics

### List Comprehensions
```python
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
```

### Decorators
```python
def decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Before function call")
        func()
        print("After function call")
    return wrapper
```

### Generators
```python
def my_generator():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3
```

---

## 11. Working with APIs
```python
import requests
response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/data")
print(response.json())
```

---

## 12. Data Analysis and Visualization

### Pandas
```python
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
print(data.head())
```

### Matplotlib
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])
plt.show()
```

### NumPy
```python
import numpy as np
array = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print(array)
```
